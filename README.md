# Geocoding-Service
This service resolves the latitude and longitude for that address by using geocoding services by Google API and HERE

This repo contains 2 files GeoCode.py and demo.py
GeoCode is the module that contains the class and the corresponding class methods' definitions. demo.py is an example implementation for anyone who wants to use this service.
There are 2 ways to use this service -
  Send one address at a time, as an argument to GeoCode and watch the result displayed on console after which the program execution ends
  Another way is to use the Run() function which takes no arguments and keeps executing requests until the user types the word exit
